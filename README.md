# Pands-Project - Analysis on the Iris Dataset


# This assignment required us to produce summary statistics for the whole dataset, as well as,
# per category of a categorical variable. 
# The dataset that I am going to analyse is the IRIS dataset.
# I will start by describing the variables and descriptive statistics related to them,
# and then I will present some insights about this dataset using graphs. My final steps in this analysis
# will include correlation and regression analysis.
