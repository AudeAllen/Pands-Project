Analysis on the Iris Dataset 
1.	Introduction to Project

Problem Statement –
1. Research the iris data set online and write a summary about it in your README. 
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository. 
3. Write a program called analysis.py that: 
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and 
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. 
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate 

I am going to be analysing the very famous dataset called the Iris dataset. The iris dataset was created by the british statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. The dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).	
I am going to be using python code and explanations of this code to discuss this dataset. Python pandas will be used as Pandas has many functions that can help analyse this dataset. There will be many other functions and libraries within Python that I will be using in order to show my findings in this project. 
This assignment will firstly produce summary statistics for the whole dataset using the Pandas dataframe function. A dataframe is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is a simple table with rows and columns. The iris dataset file will be read in from a .csv file. As well as a summary file I will be producing summary statistics per category of a categorical variable.
I am going to start by describing the variables and descriptive statistics related to them. I will then present some insights about this dataset using a number of graphs. 
I will include correlation and regression analysis in my analysis.	
I am going to be using Visual Studio Code to write my python code and readme files. I had some trouble downloading Jupyter Notebook so I will be doing all of my commenting and descriptions of my code and graphs in my README file.
The main python script is called analysis.py. 
I hope my analysis of this dataset will help give me more insight and knowledge of python and also machine learning.




2.	Software needed to run the project
-	Visual Studio Code
-	Python 3
-	Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/Pands-Project.git
How to run Python code 
Need to fill out a bit more – discussion about pandas, matplotlib, seaborn 

3.	Background on Iris Dataset
There is a lot of information and analyses done on the Iris dataset. The British statistician Ronald Fisher published the dataset in 1936.
As mentioned in my introduction iris dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


See pictures of each species of flower below.
